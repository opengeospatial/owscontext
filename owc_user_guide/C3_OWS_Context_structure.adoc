== The OWS Context Document Structure

An OWS Context (OWC) document consists of a number of key elements. These are shown in figure 3.1.

*Figure 3.1 - Structure of OWS Context Document*

The overall information includes a name,
abstract and creation date as well as a range of high level metadata. It also
includes an Area of Interest and a time range of interest (all optional). When
using OWC for visualization the Area of Interest is typically the area
displayed on screen when the context document is loaded. Similarly the
time-range of interest is the time range that any time slider in the
application will be set to. The core of the OWC document is an ordered list of resources.
Again for visualization purposes the application should load the resources in
the list such that the first resource is at the top (i.e. reverse draw
order).  

Each layer in a context document is known as a ‘Resource’ which in the Atom encoding is mapped to a ‘Entry’ XML element. In reality a resource can be realised in a number of
different ways, and so an OWC document allows various options to be specified.
These are known as offerings. The intention is that these are, as far as is
possible by the format used, equivalent and no priority is assigned to their
order in the standard. They are intended to be alternatives that the client can
use to allow it to visualise or use the resource. This structure is shown in Figure 3.2.

*Figure 3.2 - OWS Context Document Offering*

An example of two equivalent offerings is a WMS for a resource and then a WMTS request retrieving equivalent data. The client can read either and be reasonably certain that the result presented to
the user is the same.  Another example is
a resource which might offer a WFS and also in-line GML which is the equivalent
of the request. 

There are two types of offering, service
offerings and data offerings. A service offering has a service request (in the
form of a capabilities request and a data request) and optional content and
styling elements. A data offering has a content element and optional styling
elements.
